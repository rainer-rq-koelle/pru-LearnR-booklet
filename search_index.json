[["index.html", "PRU - Getting Started with R/RStudio Ecosystem Welcome", " PRU - Getting Started with R/RStudio Ecosystem RQ &amp; PRU 2021-02-16 Welcome This booklet is produced in parallel to the joint hacking sessions and serves as an aide memoire. Each (learning) journey starts with the first steps. And learning R, RStudio, the many useful R packages combine for a universe that is impossible to explore in a single go. Thus, the goal is to get you started and give you some orientation on how to navigate this universe. The booklet is not an invention of me. It uses the feedback from several runs of “intro to R” sessions. And it lives from the feedback, observations, and many ahas we had while hacking and learning together. If you find this resource useful, feel free to reuse it at your own risk!

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

If you have come here before the sessions are completed, be sure to ask for getting an intro to bookdown as one of the advanced sessions. As discussed in the intro session/section, the R/RStudio Ecosystem is in constant flux. And there is not a single “learning path” for this journey. The material presented/discussed and recorded in this booklet will get you going. And as usual … the sky is now the limit. Enjoy your journey with R/RStudio Ecosystem.

This section will be cleaned over time or forms the basis for advanced chapters. For the time being it is safe to ignore them. 6.1 Bookdown The engine behind this booklet is bookdown. The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.
