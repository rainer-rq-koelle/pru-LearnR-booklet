[["index.html", "PRU - Getting Started with R/RStudio Ecosystem Welcome", " PRU - Getting Started with R/RStudio Ecosystem RQ &amp; PRU 2021-02-16 Welcome This booklet is produced in parallel to the joint hacking sessions and serves as an aide memoire. Each (learning) journey starts with the first steps. And learning R, RStudio, the many useful R packages combine for a universe that is impossible to explore in a single go. Thus, the goal is to get you started and give you some orientation on how to navigate this universe. The booklet is not an invention of me. It uses the feedback from several runs of “intro to R” sessions. And it lives from the feedback, observations, and many ahas we had while hacking and learning together. If you find this resource useful, feel free to reuse it at your own risk! "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

Conceptually, the installation is a smoothless exercise on your private PC or Mac. Getting R/RStudio running on EUROCONTROL hardware is a slightly different story. However, before you embark on installing the software on your PC or Mac, you may want to play around and wet your feet with the help of a cloud-service. This will be briefly introduced in the next section before going further. 2.1 Wetting your feet with rstudio.cloud RStudio offers a free cloud-based service on rstudio.cloud. The free package is good enough for entry level project and coding time. With a view to use R/RStudio in the mid/long term, it is recommended that you register an account with github.com. Git/github is certainly advanced stuff. Right now it is sufficient to know that git/github will be useful in managing projects and archiving code in repositories. Think about a dropbox for your scripts, etc. Registering a github account first allows you to log in to rstudio.cloud with your github credentials. And you may benefit later from the credential based link when knowing how and why a repo is a good thing. :) Thus: register an account with github.com. Use a resonable long account name. Mine is rainer-rq-koelle. I liked it when i set it up … today I wish I would have gone for something shorter. next go to rstudio.cloud choose log on with github credentials. Voila! 2.2 Installing R/RStudio on a Computer with Admin Rights To be developed. For ECTRL set up check below. 2.3 Installing R/RStudio at work (EUROCONTROL) You can request the installation of the software via an installation ticket. Both R and RStudio belong to the “standard” software you can request via the self-service web-interface. Experience has shown that the installation is typically done within a reasonable time. However, IT security settings require some configuration. This is normally overlooked first. Assuming this is the case, you will encounter a first error when attempting to update pre-installed base packages or other packages you want to download. The error message will speak about a problem with a group policy or something similar. Thus, if you run into something like this: ... some cool error text ... &quot;group policy&quot; .... contact your system administrator contact IT Helpdesk inform them about the error; and advise them to ensure the configuration in accordance with PRU configuration settings equivalent to Enrico or Rainer. With some luck, the ticket is solved in one go. We had cases where it took a couple of attempts. But there should be enough “template tickets” in the system for the helpdesk to find back the recipe and how to connect the dots. Please also consult the PRU wiki for handy system settings. Hoping your in-house installation ride will be a smooth one! If worse comes to worse, shout for help.

It will be updated in parallel to the joint learning sessions. If you have come here before the sessions are completed, be sure to ask for getting an intro to bookdown as one of the advanced sessions. As discussed in the intro session/section, the R/RStudio Ecosystem is in constant flux. And there is not a single “learning path” for this journey. The material presented/discussed and recorded in this booklet will get you going. And as usual … the sky is now the limit. Enjoy your journey with R/RStudio Ecosystem. Share your experiences and lessons learned and developments.

This section will be cleaned over time or forms the basis for advanced chapters. For the time being it is safe to ignore them. 6.1 Bookdown The engine behind this booklet is bookdown. The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "]]
