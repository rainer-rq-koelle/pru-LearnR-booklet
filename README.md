## PRU - Getting Started with R/RStudio Ecosystem

This booklet contains the modules and supporting information on the topics tackled during the lunchtime hacking sessions.
The principal idea is to get everyone up and running with R/RStudio to conduct small data analyses.
The material builds heavily on the **tidyverse & friends**.
