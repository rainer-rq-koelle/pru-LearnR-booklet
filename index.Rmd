# Welcome {-}

This booklet is produced in parallel to the *joint hacking sessions* and serves as an aide memoire.

Each (learning) journey starts with the first steps. 
And learning R, RStudio, the many useful R packages combine for a universe that is impossible to explore in a single go.

Thus, the goal is to get you started and give you some orientation on how to navigate this universe.

The booklet is not an invention of me. It uses the feedback from several runs of "intro to R" sessions.
And it lives from the feedback, observations, and many ahas we had while hacking and learning together.

If you find this resource useful, feel free to reuse it at your own risk!
