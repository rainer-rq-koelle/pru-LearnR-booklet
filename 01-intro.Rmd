## Why you should learn R!

There are many good reasons for **"why you should learn R"**.

If you are unable to tell, then let's go with a simple fact.
The letter R can be found twice in the name RaineR. 
The R/RStudio ecosystem is very well suited to support your day-to-day work.
Analyses can be performed in a reproducible manner. This is a gem as it supports to "re-do" the work and decisions in terms of handling data artefacts are written down in code.
This creates transparency ... and your future you will thank you.

The eco-system comes with a series of value-added capabilities that the PRU uses.
Thus, being able to navigate the ecosystem/universe, adding to its further development, or build new tools/outputs is a skill that will be useful and fun at the same time.

As a teaser, this booklet is written with the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] which is on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
If this does not ring a bell with you today, do not worry. Just look at this as an example of the power of the **ecosystem** and how we can combine packages to create on online book like this booklet.
And something that you will learn throughout the next sessions ... all on the basis of combining prose and data analytics, and rendering this into a useful output format.

In case of doubt ... there are 2 Rs in RaineR ... thus, it must be double-good!

## R/RStudio "Ecosystem"

We speak about an ecosystem as the combination of R, a useful interface, and many packages supporting the **magic**.

It is worth to understand that R is the computational heart.

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides us a cockpit to "fly" R.

Packages are supporting stuff that typically make life easier, faster, or more efficient.
Think about a seat heating or GPS navigation system in a car. 

At the time of writing (Febr 2021), the CRAN package repository features 17105 available packages.
Mind you that there are other package repositories from which we can benefit.
It will be impossible to walk through all of these packages.
And while we speak/learn, some will retire and others are newly added.
Hence, we look at it as a living **ecosystem**.

This course series is about getting you going. Obviously, there is not a single learning path.
A wealth of information can be found on the internet. 
Many may take you to parts of the universe/ecosystem that are interesting.
However, do not attempt to follow blindly tutorials, introduction courses, etc. 
The universe is vast. You may become a super-hero in so many disciplines.
Take what is useful for you or the problem you are working on and feel free to jump to other material if you feel being taken of course. 

In the end, your R/RStudio ecosystem path will not be a copy of mine or the other course participants.
But we surely can share some of the first steps of this journey.


## An opionated set of learning resources

This **getting started guide** focusses on the workflow to perform a data analysis.
In broad terms, this revolves around the creation or loading of data, its transformation and analytical summary, including associated visualisation, and - in a final step - the production of an output "report".
The output in itself can be a one-pager or a long technical report (aka "document"), web-pages or dashboards.

The following learning resources can help to fill in where this guide leaves blanks or for secondary study:
